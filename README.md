# Artificial-Intelligence-for-the-Media-Mini-Project

The files found in this repository are all files related to my Mini-Project for the Artificial Intelligence for the Media course. The only files not included in this repository are the datasets, as they are too large to be uploaded. These datasets are available via sharepoint here: https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/m_beaty0520221_arts_ac_uk/EoGmv2Sotb1KlRN0t10Oyn4BNAiE2HVdAkegYp37dzhEiQ?e=b5tG3h.

The rest of this repository includes:
1. Four notebooks attempting various Pix2Pix models. These notebooks use the Image Pairs and Training_small datasets available on sharepoint. Both of these datasets are within the Pix2Pix datasets folder. 

2. One notebook attempting a CycleGAN generative model. This notebook uses the CycleGAN dataset available on the sharepoint.

3. A folder containing the CycleGAN generated images.

4. A PDF Project Brief explaining the process involved with this project, the project aims, difficulties, and results.
